# portfolio
A website that will serve as a portfolio. It will hold links to projects I create.

## why am i doing this
This is my first foray into django. I am following their guide to making my first django project, while also making a blogs app in that project
concurrently. That blogs app is my own version of the polls app the django team gave in the django tutorial.
